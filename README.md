# Perceptron(1-Layer)

Language: C#

## Note:

Write a program for training a single layer perceptron with a delta rule.
1. The used activation function is the threshold activation function.
2. Initial weights - real numbers from -1 to 1.
3. The value of the learning rate:
  • option 1 (odd according to the list): 0.05; 0.1; 0.25; 0.5; 0.75; 0.9.
  • option 2 (even according to the list): 0.03; 0.2; 0.4; 0.6; 0.8; 0.95.
4. Number of learning epochs: 20.
5. Conduct 6 experiments (with different learning rates).
6. Derivation of learning outcomes by epoch: root-mean-square error.
It is also necessary to build graphs for each experiment with a change in the value
errors in the learning process by epochs (along the x-axis - epochs, along the y-axis - values
mean square error)
